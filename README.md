# üß† CrossKD-IFC: Cross-Head Knowledge Distillation with Intermediate Feature Combination

This repository contains the implementation of our improved knowledge distillation method for object detection:  
**CrossKD-IFC** ‚Äì an enhancement of CrossKD with intermediate feature aggregation.

---

## üìñ Overview

**Knowledge Distillation (KD)** has been proven to be an effective model compression technique for training compact object detectors. While most recent KD methods primarily focus on **feature imitation**, we propose an improved version of **CrossKD**‚Äîa general and effective **prediction mimicking-based KD approach**.

In our method, **intermediate features from multiple layers** of the student model's detection head are **combined and transferred** to the teacher model's detection head. The resulting **cross-head predictions** are then forced to mimic the teacher's outputs, helping to reduce conflicts between ground-truth labels and the teacher‚Äôs predictions. This enhances both the **effectiveness and training stability** of the distillation process.

### üî¨ Key Improvements
- üí° Unlike the original CrossKD that uses only one intermediate feature layer, our method **aggregates features from multiple layers**.
- ‚öôÔ∏è This **multi-layer feature fusion** provides richer, more informative representations for distillation.
- üöÄ We retain the **original loss functions** from CrossKD, making our method easy to plug into existing frameworks.

### üìä Experimental Results

| Dataset     | Teacher (Backbone)      | Student (Backbone)     | Method           | mAP   |
|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|--------|
| Pascal VOC  | Faster R-CNN (ResNet-101) | Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50) | Baseline         | 70.1   |
|             |                          |                          | CrossKD-IFC      | **73.5** |
| COCO        | Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50)  | Faster R-CNN (ResNet-18) | Baseline         | 33.5   |
|             |                          |                          | CrossKD-IFC      | **35.9** |

These results confirm that our **Intermediate Feature Combination** strategy outperforms the original CrossKD and other KD methods.
